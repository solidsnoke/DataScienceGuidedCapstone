Note that this relies on the implicit assumption that all other resorts are largely setting prices based on how much people value certain facilities. Essentially this assumes prices are set by a free market.\n",

On the one hand, we are _not_ trying to estimate model performance on a previously unseen data sample, so theoretically including Big Mountain data should be fine. One might first think that including Big Mountain in the model training would, if anything, improve model performance in predicting Big Mountain's ticket price. But here's where our business context comes in. The motivation for this entire project is based on the sense that Big Mountain needs to adjust its pricing. One way to phrase this problem: we want to train a model to predict Big Mountain's ticket price based on data from _all the other_ resorts! We don't want Big Mountain's current price to bias this. We want to calculate a price based only on its competitors."

What does your modelling suggest for a ticket price that could be supported in the marketplace by Big Mountain's facilities? How would you approach suggesting such a change to the business leadership? Discuss the additional operating cost of the new chair lift per ticket (on the basis of each visitor on average buying 5 day tickets) in the context of raising prices to cover this. For future improvements, state which, if any, of the modeled scenarios you'd recommend for further consideration. Suggest how the business might test, and progress, with any run closures."

To suggest this change, I would highlight the competitive positioning, estimated revenue gains, and customer perception. The new chair lift introduces an additional $3 per ticket in operating costs (assuming five-day ticket purchases per visitor), which could be offset by the price increase. For future improvements, the expanding snow-making capacity and run lengths seems best, as these features contribute to pricing power and visitor satisfaction. Run closures should be tested by temporarily limiting access and analyzing visitor feedback and revenue impact before making any permanent changes."

Big Mountain was already fairly high on some of the league charts of facilities offered, but why was its modeled price so much higher than its current price? Would this mismatch come as a surprise to the business executives? How would you find out? Assuming the business leaders felt this model was useful, how would the business make use of it? Would you expect them to come to you every time they wanted to test a new combination of parameters in a scenario? We hope you would have better things to do, so how might this model be made available for business analysts to use and explore?"

Big Mountain ranked well in facility comparisons, but its current price was lower than the modeled price, possibly due to historical pricing strategies, competitive pressures, or customer expectations. Leadership might be surprised by this gap, so conducting customer and competitor research would help make sure whether a price adjustment is realistic. If leadership finds this model useful, they could use it for scenario testing, but relying on a data team for every adjustment would be inefficient. To give analysts more data to work with, the model could be packaged into an interactive tool where they can input different variables and see expected pricing and revenue impacts in real time."
